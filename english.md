#Introduction
####The following rules apply to all official services of Equinox Realms.
####Any attempt of getting around the rules and therefore finding loopholes, will result in a ban, the severity of the ban based off an administrators judgement.
####We have the right to ban any player from our network for any reason at any time.
####Being punished for any rule, does not mean you have a right to refund any money you have donated to Equinox Realms.
####These rules are subject to change with or without notice, and players are responsible for keeping up with the rules. New rules have a one week grace period.
