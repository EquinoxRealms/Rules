#Introduction
####The following rules apply to all official services of Equinox Realms.
####Any attempt of getting around the rules and therefore finding loopholes, will result in a ban; the severity of the ban based off an administrators judgement.
####Assisting, or allowing a player to break any of the rules on this page, will result in issuing you a punishment due to your connection to the rule breaker.
####We have the right to punish any player from our network for any reason, at any time.
####Being punished for any rule, does not mean you have a right to refund any money you have donated to Equinox Realms. 
####These rules are subject to change with or without notice, and players are responsible for keeping up with the rules. New rules consist of a one week grace period.

#Client Modifications
Hacked/Ghost clients of any type are not allowed on the network. Such hacks are, but not limited to, kill aura, trigger bot, fly hacks, aimbot, knockback modifiers, autoclickers, etc. Any hacked clients will result in a permanent ban from the network.

Unapproved modifications of any kind are disallowed. You can see our approved mods list here. If caught with an unapproved modification, you will receive a 14 day ban, with a permanent ban to follow for a second offence.

It is prohibited to use any third party program that directly interferes with the minecraft client which provides an unfair advantage to other users. Therefore you may never use, autoclickers, macros, multiple attack buttons, drag clicking, butterfly clicking, etc is not allowed. The general rule is one finger, one button, one click. Disobeying this rule will result in a permanent ban.

Purposefully making yourself look as if you are hacking will result in the same punishment as the hack you were pretending to use has.
